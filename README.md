This project was developed as part of CIS*2750, University of Guelph, taught by Prof. Stefan C Kremer, Winter 2024. 

This is a full stack project that allows the user to play pool against another player. It was build using C (for the pool physics), sqlite (to keep track of the balls on the table), python (to launch the server and interface for the C code) and HTML/CSS/JQuery (for the website). 

This project is built to be used on the University of Guelph server.
